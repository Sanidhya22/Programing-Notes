                                  -----------------------

   What is Agile methodology ?
-> Agile methodology is a set of practices for software development.
   In agile methodology we receive regular feedback from customers and deliver regular updates and requirement is
   not fixed and it can change any time.

   What is Sprint ?
-> Sprint is a time interval cycle for software development.
   usually 2 Weeks = 1 Sprint                                  

   What is sprint planning meeting ?
-> Planning for upcoming sprint where we plan for upcoming sprint like what tickets we will take or if tickets
   taken assign pointers to it.

   What is PI Planning (Program Increment Planning) ?
-> Planning for work for upcoming quater and setting quater goal.

   What is Daily standup meeting ?
-> Daily standup meeting is a meeting where we dicuss about what work we have done yesterday and what work you 
   are gonna do today and also raise our concers if any.

   What is Sprint Retrospective meeting ?
-> It is a meeting that we set after the end of the sprint to dicuss what have done well and what we can improve
   Here we also setup actions items to work on it afterwards.

   What is Story points ?
-> Story points are the points which defines what amount of work is needed to perform a task.

   What is Epic ?
-> It is a group of stories for a functionality that we can not cover in a single sprint.

   What is a scrum master ?
-> The person who leads the sprint planning or sprint related meeting is called scrum master.

   What is zero sprint ?
-> Before first sprint whatever time we have for planning that we call zero sprint.

   What is spike ?
-> Spike is term used for a defining work where we do R&D , where requirement and conclusion is not clear.

   What is velocity ?
-> velocity tells us in a particular sprint how much work is delivered. 

   Difference between burn-up and burn-down chart ?
-> Burn-up chart: A burn-up chart shows how much work completed against the total work.  
   Burn-down chart: A burn-down chart shows how much work is left to be completed against the total work.

   Difference between Waterfall model and Agile model in software development ?
-> Waterfall Model: -
1. It involves phase wise development.
2. It involves collecting all project requirements at the begining.
3. It provides limited flexibility, when one phase is completed it is challenging to go back to previous phase.
4. It involves late customer feedback.   

   Agile Model -
   ----------------------------
1. It breaks down the development process into small, iterative cycles.
2. It provides customer satifaction. 
3. Faster delivery of new updates.
4. Requirement is not clear it can change anytime.
5. It does not involve collecting all project requirements at the begining.

   What do you mean by Scrum ?
-> Scrum is a framework for managing and completing projects.  

   Defines the roles in the Scrum ? 
-> There are 3 different primary roles in Scrum -
   Scrum Master  -- The Scrum Master is a person who facilitate Scrum events (such as Daily Stand-ups, Sprint 
   Planning, Sprint Review, and Sprint Retrospective).
   Product Owner -- The Product Owner represents the stakeholders and define the product vision, prioritize the
   product backlog.
   Team -- Developers and QA members
 
   Difference between Product backlog and Sprint backlog ? 
-> Product Backlog: - 
1. Product backlog as a to-do list for the entire project. It's a prioritized list of all the features, 
   enhancements, bug fixes, and other tasks that need to be done to complete the project.
2. It is managed by product owner.

   Sprint Backlog: -
1. The sprint backlog is like a subset of the product backlog but for a sprint in Agile development.
2. It is managed by scrum master.
   
   Explain Iterative and Incremental development in agile ?   
-> Iterative Development -- 
   Iterative development is about development happens in repetitive cycles and in each cycle we do some work, get 
   feedback, and then improve the project.
   
   Incremental Development --
   Incremental development is about adding new features or improvements to the project in small increments.

   What is kanban ?
-> Kanban is a visual workflow management method used to manage and optimize the flow of work in a project or 
   process.  

   What are the pros and cons of Agile methodlogy ?
-> Pros of Agile methodlogy -
   1. It breaks down the development process into small, iterative cycles.
   2. It provides customer satifaction. 
   3. Faster delivery of new updates.
   4. Requirement is not clear it can change anytime.
   5. It does not involve collecting all project requirements at the begining.

   Cons of Agile methodlogy -
   1. It has adaptability challenges.
   2. It is resource intensive.
   3. It involves dependency management. 

   What are the different types of Agile Methodologies ?
-> There are several Agile methodologies, each with its own approach to software development. Here are some of 
   the most commonly used ones:   
1. Scrum - Scrum is a framework for managing and completing projects. It consists of iterative development cycles
   called Sprints. Scrum includes specific roles (Scrum Master, Product Owner, Development Team), events (Sprint
   Planning, Daily Stand-ups, Sprint Review, Sprint Retrospective), and artifacts (Product Backlog, Sprint Backlog).

2. Kanban - Kanban is a visual workflow management method used to manage and optimize the flow of work in a project or 
   process. It uses a Kanban board to visualize the flow of work items through various stages of a process. 
   Work items are represented as cards or sticky notes, and columns represent different stages of the workflow.

3. Extreme Programming (XP) - Extreme Programming (XP) is a method of software development that focuses on high-quality code.
   It's like a set of practices designed to make sure the software being developed is the best it can be.

4. Lean Software Development - Lean software development is like applying the principles of efficiency 
   in the process of software development to minimizing waste. 

5. Dynamic Systems Development Method - It is method of software development that focus on Rapid Application 
   Development (RAD), which involves rapid prioritizing and iteration development based on user feedback.

   What do you mean by Planning Poker ? 
-> Planning poker is a estimation technique used in Agile and Scrum methodologies to estimate the size of user
   stories or tasks. 

   Benefits of Planning Poker - 
   1. Shared Understanding
   2. Improved Estimation Accuracy
   3. Risk Identification 
   4. Speed and Efficiency     

   When we are estimating tickets, what are a different estimation techniques we can use ?
-> The following are the estimation techniques we use for estimating ticket points - 
   1. Planner Pocker - 
      Planning poker is a collaborative estimation technique where team members vote pointers for ticket and 
      at last average of pointers is considered for final assignment of point to ticket.

   2. Bucket System - 
      Estimating tickets based on their complexity in small, medium and large sizes work instead of extact 
      pointer estimation.

   3. Affinity Maping system -
      Estimation technique used during the early stages of a project or when gathering requirements.
      In this estimation technique we group similar kind of tasks together.

   4. T Shirt size estimation - 
      Estimating tickets based on their complexity in small, medium and large sizes work instead of extact 
      pointer estimation.

   5. Dot voting
      Estimating tickets based on vote by team members. most favoured vote is considered as final pointer.

   What is the difference between functional and non-functional requirements ?
->                      Functional                       |                    Non Functional   
   -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    1. Functional requirements describe the specific       1. Non-functional requirements describe the qualities 
       behaviors software application that it must            or attributes that a software application should possess,
       perform to meet the needs of its users                 such as performance, reliability, security,
       or stakeholders.                                       and scalability.

    2. Functional requirements describe what the           2. Non-functional requirements describe how well the 
       software does.                                         software does it.

    3. Functional requirements are more easy to            3. Non-functional requirements are more challenging 
       measurable and verifiable.                             to measure precisely.

    4. Functional Testing methods involves methods         4. Non functional Testing involves methods like 
       like unit testing, integration testing ,               performance testing, security testing, compatibility
       system testing and acceptance testing.                 scalability testing.   


   What do you mean by task and user story ?
-> A user story is a simple, non-technical description of a feature or functionality from the perspective of an
   end user.    
   A task is a specific piece of work that needs to be done to complete a user story or achieve a goal.
