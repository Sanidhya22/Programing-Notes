                                  Situational Based Questions
                           --------------------------------------------

1.  You're tasked with optimizing the performance of a web application that's experiencing slow load times. How
    would you approach this problem ?  
->  First, I would analyze the application's performance metrics and the web application to pinpoint areas
    causing slow load times, such as server response time, database queries, large file sizes, or excessive 
    network requests. Then, I would prioritize improvements based on their impact on user experience 
    and resource consumption.
    I will try below techniques -

    Optimize Frontend: Minimize CSS, JavaScript, and image file sizes, utilize browser caching, and reduce 
    the number of HTTP requests by combining resources. Implement lazy loading for images and scripts to 
    improve initial load times.

    Browser Caching: Leverage browser caching to store static resources locally, reducing the need for repeated 
    downloads on subsequent visits.

    Backend Optimization: Optimize database queries, utilize caching mechanisms (like Redis), and implement 
    efficient server-side processing to reduce response times.

    Minimize Redirects: Minimize the number of redirects, as each redirect adds an additional HTTP 
    request-response cycle, increasing load times.

    I would also conduct load testing to simulate heavy traffic scenarios and identify performance issues under 
    stress and ensure that optimizations don't introduce new issues under heavy traffic.


2.  A critical security vulnerability has been discovered in one of the libraries used by your application. How 
    would you handle this situation ?
->  I will take below steps to handle this situation -
    1. Assess the Severity: Understand the impact and severity of the vulnerability. Determine if it's a critical
       issue that requires immediate attention or if it can be patched during the next regular update.

    2. Identify Affected Components: Identify which parts of the application are using the vulnerable library 
       and assess the potential risk to the system.   

    3. Find Patch or Update: Check if a patch or update is available for the vulnerable library. If yes, apply 
       the patch immediately to fix the vulnerability.

    4. Implement Workarounds (if needed): If a patch is not available or cannot be applied immediately, 
       consider implementing temporary workarounds to mitigate the risk until a proper fix can be applied. 

    5. Notify Stakeholders: Inform relevant stakeholders, including the development team, management, and 
       possibly users/customers, about the vulnerability and the actions being taken to address it. 

    6. Monitor for Exploitation: Keep a close eye on the application for any signs of exploitation or 
       unauthorized access resulting from the vulnerability.

    7. Review Security Practices: Conduct a review of security practices to identify any weaknesses that may 
       have contributed to the vulnerability and implement measures to prevent similar issues in the future.

    8. Stay Informed: Stay informed about security updates and vulnerabilities related to the application's 
       dependencies to proactively address any future issues.

    inadequate testing, lack of code reviews, or deployment issues. Then, I would implement measures to address 
    these issues, such as improving testing practices (unit, integration, and end-to-end testing), implementing 
    code reviews, enhancing monitoring and alerting systems, and automating deployment processes with continuous
    integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines. Additionally, implementing a culture of quality and 
    accountability within the team would be essential to prevent similar incidents in the future.    


7.  Your company is planning to adopt a new technology stack for an upcoming project. How would you evaluate and
    decide on the most suitable technologies to use ?
->  I would start by conducting a thorough evaluation of the project requirements, considering factors such as 
    performance, scalability, maintainability, and compatibility with existing systems. Then, I would research 
    and compare different technology options, considering factors like community support, documentation, 
    ecosystem maturity, and potential risks. Additionally, I would involve relevant stakeholders, such as 
    team members, architects, and product owners, in the decision-making process to ensure alignment with 
    business goals and technical expertise.


8.  You've been assigned to lead a cross-functional team on a project with tight deadlines. How would you plan 
    and manage the project to ensure its successful delivery ?
