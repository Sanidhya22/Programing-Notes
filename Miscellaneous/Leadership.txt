   You have to remove a member from your team, who do you choose ? OR 
   You are asked by the client to remove a team member.  What factors would you consider when removing a team 
   member ? OR 
   You need to remove a member from your team due to cost, what factors would you take into account when deciding
   who to remove ?
-> If I have to remove someone from team I will consider following things -
   1. Performance and Contribution
   2. Skills and Expertise
   3. Communication and Collaboration
   4. Attitude and Behavior
   5. Impact on Team Dynamics

   Can you tell me how you would deal with a low performer on your team ? OR 
   A member of your team is under-performing, what do you do ?
-> I will follow below things while tackling with low performer -
   1. Open Communication - setup meeting with candidate and discuss about his performance.
   2. Identify Root Causes - I will discuss with him for the rootcause of his low performance, it could be anything 
      like workload, skillgap, lacking domain experience, personal issues etc.
   3. Provide Support and Resources - Offer support, guidance, and resources to help the team member improve 
      their performance. This could include additional training, mentoring, coaching, or assistance in overcoming specific 
      challenges they may be facing.
   4. Set Clear Goals and Action Plan - I will setup an action plan for improvement. Break down the goals into smaller, 
      manageable steps and set deadlines for progress checkpoints.  
   5. Regular Check-ins and Feedback - Schedule regular check-ins to monitor progress and provide ongoing feedback and support.
   6. Be Prepared for Tough Decisions - While the goal is to support the team member in improving their performance, also be 
      prepared to make tough decisions if performance does not improve despite efforts. 

   Consider a situation where a junior developer is struggling to meet the coding standards set by the team, 
   leading to code review feedback that they find demotivating. How would you provide constructive feedback to 
   help them improve without discouraging their progress ?
-> I would start by acknowledging the junior developer's effort and highlighting any positive aspects of their 
   work. Then, I would gently point out the specific areas where improvements can be made, highlight relevant 
   best practices or coding standards. Instead of simply pointing out flaws, I would offer suggestions for how 
   the code could be refactored or improved to align with best practices and maintainability. It's crucial to 
   provide feedback in a constructive and supportive manner to foster the junior developer's growth and 
   confidence.     

   You're team lead on a new project, what is your current plan of action ?
-> Starting a new project as a team lead involves several key steps to ensure a successful kickoff and smooth 
   execution. Here's my plan of action:

   1. Understand the Project Scope and Objectives - Begin by thoroughly understanding the project scope, 
      objectives, requirements, and constraints. 
   2. Formulate a Project Plan - Develop a detailed project plan outlining the timeline, deliverables, 
      milestones, and dependencies. Identify key resources, roles, and responsibilities within the team.
   3. Assemble the Team - Identify and assemble a cross-functional team with the necessary skills and expertise 
      to execute the project effectively. 
   4. Define Communication Channels - Establish clear communication channels and protocols for regular updates, 
      progress tracking, and issue resolution within the team and with stakeholders. Ensure open and transparent
      communication throughout the project lifecycle.
   5. Set Up Project Infrastructure -  Set up project infrastructure including version control systems, 
      collaboration tools, project management software, and any other necessary tools or resources to support
      team collaboration and productivity.
   6. Define Development Processes - Define development processes and methodologies tailored to the project's
      needs, whether it be Agile, Waterfall, or a hybrid approach. Establish guidelines for requirements 
      gathering, design, development, testing, and deployment.
   7. Prioritize and Plan Iterations - Break down the project into manageable iterations or sprints, 
      prioritizing features and tasks based on business value, complexity, and dependencies. Conduct sprint 
      planning sessions to allocate work and set achievable goals for each iteration.
   8. Monitor Progress and Performance - Implement mechanisms for monitoring project progress and performance 
      against established metrics and KPIs. Conduct regular status meetings, retrospectives, and reviews to 
      track progress, identify bottlenecks, and make necessary adjustments.
