   2. Understand Concerns - Listen carefully to both sides to understand their perspectives and concerns 
      regarding the proposed solution. Ensure that all viewpoints are heard and respected.

      decisions, involve senior team members or technical leads to provide guidance and expertise.

      Encourage compromise and exploration of alternative solutions if necessary.
