    different data attributes and the various relationships between the data values.

    What do you mean by NoSQL ?
->  NOSQL databases are databases that stores data in documents rather than relational databases.
    It stores data in the form of object (key value)

    What is the difference between SQL and NOSQL databases ?  
->                           SQL                |                       NOSQL
     1. SQL is used in Relational database         1. NOSQL is used in Non relational or distributed 
        management  System.                           database System.
     2. These databases have a fixed and static    2. These database have a dynamic schema.
        or predefined schema.   
     3. Data is stored in the tabular format in    3. Data is stored in the documents format  
        database.                                     in database. 

     4. Vertically Scalable.                       4. Horizontal Scalable.

    
    What are the different types in which SQL command are categories ?
->   DDL – Data Definition Language   - Create , Drop, Alter, Truncate
     DQL – Data Query Language        - Select
     DML – Data Manipulation Language - Insert, Update, Delete
     DCL – Data Control Language      - Grant, Revoke
     TCL – Transaction Control Language - Commit, Rollback, Savepoint


     What are the advantage of NOSQL database over SQL database ?
->   These are the advantage of the NOSQL database over SQL databases 
     1. Flexible 
     2. Scalable
     3. High Performance
     4. Availability

     What is the difference Drop and Delete command in MYSQL ?
 ->                          DELETE                |               Drop
     1. Delete command deletes all the records       1. Drop command deletes all the records from 
        from the database.                              the database along with the table schema.

     2. WHERE clause is used to add filtering.       2. No WHERE clause is available.

     3. Delete command can be rollbacked.            3. Drop command can not be rollbacked.


     What is the difference between Drop and Truncate in MYSQL ?
                            TRUNCATE                |               Drop
 ->   1. Truncate command deletes all the records       1. Drop command deletes all the records from 
         from the database.                                the database along with the table schema. 

      2. It is fast as compared to the DROP command.    2. It is slow as compared to the TRUNCATE command.


     What do you mean by Views and why we use it ?
->   Views is a virtual table based on the resultset of the SQL statement. 
     View we need to simplify SQL queries and allow secure access to underlying tables.
