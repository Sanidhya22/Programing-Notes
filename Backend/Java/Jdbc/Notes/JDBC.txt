                                            JDBC
                    -------------------------------------------------------------

  What do you mean by JDBC ?
  • JDBC is an Application Programming Interface(API) for Java, which is helpful for interaction with the 
    database and for executing the SQL query.
  • JDBC stands for Java Database Connectivity. 

  What do you mean by ODBC ?
  • ODBC is an open specification containing rules and guidelines to develop odbc drivers for different 
    DB software.

  What are the Components of JDBC ?
  There are four major components of JDBC using which it can interact with a database. They are:
  1. JDBC API: it provides different methods and interfaces for easier communication with the database. 
     By using this applications are able to execute SQL statements, retrieve results and make updation 
     to the database.
  2. JDBC DriverManager: it is the class in JDBC API. It loads the JDBC driver in a Java application for 
     establishing a connection with the database. It is useful in making a database-specific call for 
     processing the user request.
  3. JDBC Test suite: It is used to test the operations like insertion, deletion, updation etc., being 
     performed by JDBC Drivers.
  4. JDBC-ODBC bridge drivers -  It will connect database drivers to the database. JDBC-ODBC bridge 
     interprets JDBC method call to the ODBC function call.
