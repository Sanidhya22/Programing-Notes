                                ---------------------------------

    What do you mean by Git ?
->  Git is a DevOps tool used for source code management. It is a free and open-source version control 
    system used to handle small to very large projects efficiently. Git is used to tracking changes in 
    the source code, enabling multiple developers to work together on non-linear development.
    Git is a Distributed Version Control System.

    What do you mean by Repository in Git ?
->  A Git repository tracks and saves the history of all changes made to the files in a Git project. It
    saves this data in a directory called . git , also known as the repository folder. Git uses a version
    control system to track all changes made to the project and save them in the repository.  

    What do you by Version Control System ?
->  Version Control System helps in maintaing the different versions of the source code for the 
    different changes in the source Code and It maintains a history of what changes have happened.   

    What do you mean by Distributed Version Control System ? 
->  Git has a remote repository which is stored in a server and a local repository which is stored in the
    computer of each developer. This means that the code is not just stored in a central server, but the 
    full copy of the code is present in all the developers’ computers. Git is a Distributed Version 
    Control System since the code is present in every developer’s computer.  

    What do you mean by Stagging area ?
->  The Staging area is a file, generally contained in your Git directory, that stores information 
    about what will go into your next commit.

    What do you mean by Peroforming Stashing ?
->  Git stash saves the uncommitted changes locally, allowing you to make changes, switch branches, and
    perform other Git operations.    

    Need for Statshing Changes 
    1. When we do Changes in current branch and try to checkout to another branch without commiting those
       changes then git does not allow us to checkout to another branch.

    2. If Sometimes Git allow us to checkout to another branch without commiting those changes then In that 
       we have a problem of having those changes in our another branch which was not supposed to happen.   

    What do you mean by Untracted files in git ?
->  Untracked files are files that have been created within your repo's working directory but have not 
    yet been added to the Staging area.    

    How to configure Username or Password in gitbash ?
->  we have to run following commands for Setting Username and Password in gitbash 
    git config --global user.name "Username"
    git config --global user.email "EmailId"
    git config --global user.password "Password" 


    Working Directory ------->  Stagging Area/ -------->  Local Repository/  -------> Remote Repository
                                 Cache Area               Committed Area          
                  git add filename        git commit -m "msg"           git push origin branchname 


    What is the diffrence between git pull and git fetch ?
->  Git Pull basically download the changes from the remote Repository and merge those changes to 
    the Working Repository.
    Git Fetch basically download the changes from the remote Repository but It does not merge those
    changes to the Working Repository.

    What do you mean git Fetch Command ?
->  The git fetch command downloads commits, files, and refs from a remote repository into 
    your local repo.  
    It basically updates the remote tracking banches. 

    What do you mean by Merging Code in Git ?
->  Merging code allows multiple software developers to integrate changes into their codebase.
    Note - When we merge one Branch to another then Commits from one Branch will get added to 
           Another Branch. 

    What do you mean by Hash Value ?
->  Git uses a Secure Hash Algorithm 1 to generate Hash value for each Commit.   

    What do you mean by Conflicts in Git ?
->  A Conflict arises when two separate branches have made edits to the same line in a file, or when a 
    file has been deleted in one branch but edited in the other.    

    What does soft and hard option does in git reset ?
->
