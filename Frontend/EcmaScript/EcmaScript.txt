3. What do you understand by Callback and Callback hell in JavaScript?
-> Callback: It is used to handle the execution of function after the completion of the 
   execution of another function. A callback would be helpful in working with events. 
   In the callback, a function can be passed as an argument to another function. 
   It is a great way when we are dealing with basic cases such as minimal asynchronous 
   operations.

   working with callback is messy. This excessive Callback nesting is often referred to as 
   Callback hell.
