   What is React Router ?
-> React Router is a popular library for handling routing in React applications. It enables you to manage the 
   navigation and URL changes within your single-page application (SPA). React Router provides a declarative way
   to define routes and their corresponding components, allowing you to render different components based on the
   URL.   

   What is the purpose of push() and replace() methods of history ?
-> The push() and replace() methods are used to manipulate the browser's history stack. They allow you to change
   the URL programmatically without causing a full page reload.
   1. push - It adds a new entry to the browser's history, which allows the user to navigate back to the 
      previous URL using the browser's back button.
   2. replace - The replace() method is similar to push() but it replaces the current entry in the history stack 
      instead of adding a new one.
