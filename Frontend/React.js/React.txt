   JSX makes it easier to write and add HTML in React.

   What are Components in React?
-> Components are Independent and resuable bit of codes.They serve the same work
   Like JavaScript function does.

   What do you mean by Class Component in React?
-> These components are made of simple classes that add functionality to the application.
   A class component requires us to extend from React.Component and create a render function
   which returns a React element.

   What do you mean by Functional Component in React?
-> A React functional component is a simple JavaScript function that accepts props and returns
   a React element.
  
   What are the differences between react Class Components and function Components?

   1.These Components are made up of      1. These are Component are like simple JavaScript 
    simple classes.                         function that accepts props and return React elements.

   2.There is a render method in class    2.There is no any render method in function component.
     component which returns react
     element.  

   3.Constructors are used.               3.Constructors are not used.

   What is State in React?
-> The state is an object where we store property values that belongs to the component. 

   What do you mean by Props?
-> Props are like functional arguments that are passed to the components as Attributes.

   What are the diffrence between state and Props in React?

      to other component.

    2.It is immutable.                        2.It is mutable.

    3.Props are readonly.                     3.State is both read and write.  

   What is defaultProps in React ?
-> The defaultProps is a React component property that allows us to set default values for the
   props argument. 

   What is PropTypes in React ?
-> PropTypes are a way to validate the values types that are passed to the component as props.

   Why we specify Key during passing Attributes for Props?
-> Keys are used in React to identify which items in the list are changed, updated, or deleted.

   What are the different LifeCycles Methods of React Class components?
-> These following are the different Life Cycle Methods of class Component --

   1.ComponentWillMount    -- This Function is called before the Component is rendered into DOM.
   2.ComponentDid6Mount    -- This function is called after the Component is renderd into DOM.
   3.ShouldComponentUpdate -- It allows us to check and realize if the rendering of the component is needed or not. It always 
    return the boolean value and on the basis of the true and false value, we will render the 
    components
   3.ComponentWillUpdate  -- This function is invoked before the Component Updation occurs.
   4.ComponentDidUpdate   -- This function is called after the Component is Updated.
   5.ComponentWillUnMount -- This function is called before the component is removed or 
     Destroyed Permanently.

   What do you mean by hooks in react?
-> Hooks are the concepts were added in the react 16.8 version.
   React Hooks are simple JavaScript functions that we can use to isolate the reusable part from a 
   functional component. 
   Hooks also allow functional components to have access to state and other React features

   What are the differnet types of hooks in React?
-> The Different types of Hooks in React -
    1. useEffect
    2. useState
    3. useContext
    4. useReducer
    5. useMemo
    6. useRef

    What do you mean useState ?
->  UseState is a Hook that allows us to have state variables in functional components.
    The React useState Hook allows us to keep track of state variable in a function component.
       
    Why we extends our class from React.Component in creating React Class Component?
->  This statement creates an inheritance to React.Component, and gives your component access to 
    React.Component's functions.

    Why we use render Method inside class Component ?
->  In the Class Componenet render() method allows us reading props and state and return our JSX code to 
    the root component of our app.

    What do you mean by UseEffect in React?
->  UseEffect is a React Hook that tells our component What needs to be done after Component 
    rendering and Component Upation.
    useEffect(<function>, <dependency>)

    What do you mean by createContext in React?
->  createContext is used to create common data that have access throughout the component 
    hierarchy without passing the props down manually to each level.

    What do you mean by Prop Drilling ?
->  Prop Drilling means Passing data through several nested children components in order 
    to deliver the data to the deeply nested Component.    

    What do you mean useContext ?
->  The React useContext provides data to components no matter how deep they are in the 
    components tree. The useContext is used to manage global data.   

    what do you mean by ContextAPI ?

    component without passing the props down manually to each level.
    It is Consisting of Providers and Consumers.    

    What do you mean by useParams ?
->  useParams returns an object of key/value pairs of url parameters.

    What do you mean by useLocation ?

    What do you mean by UseHistory?
->  useHistory hook allows us to access React Router's DOM history object.

    What do you mean Controlled Components ?
->  React, Controlled Components are those in which form’s data is handled by the component’s state.

    What do you mean by Controlled Componenets ?
->  Uncontrolled Components are the components that are not controlled by the React state and are 
    handled by the DOM (Document Object Model). So in order to access any value that has been entered we 
    take the help of refs.    

    What do you mean by Statefull Components ?
->  Statefull Components are the Components that holds some state.  

    What do you mean by Stateless Components ?
->  Stateless Components are the Components that does not holds any state. 

    What do you mean by Pure Component in React ?

    State and Props.    

    What do you mean by useMemo ?
->  React useMemo Hook returns a  memoized Value. 
    The useMemo Hook only runs when one of its Dependencies Update.  
    The useMemo Hook can be used to avoid expensive resource, intensive functions from 
    needlessly running.
    The useMemo Hook to memorize the expensive function Calculation. This will cause the function
    to only run when needed.
    The useMemoHook accepts a second parameter to declare dependencies. The expensive function
    will only run when its dependencies have changed.

    What do you Mean by useRef ?
->  useRef can be used to access a HTML DOM elements directly.
    When we use ref as Attribute in any HTML element then specified value provided to ref will 
    access to all of the properties of that HTML element.
    useRef() only returns one item. It returns an Object called current.
    When we initialize useRef we set the initial value: useRef(0).

     What do you mean by React.memo in React ?
->   It is a higher-order component that takes a React component as its first argument and returns
     a Pure React Component.
     React Functional components can not leverage the performance improvements and render optimization
     that comes with the React.PureComponent since they are not classes by optimization so that Why
     for the optimization of functional components React.Memo concept is being to React.

    What do you mean by useCallback ?
->  useCallback hooks returns a memoized callback function. 
    useCallback hooks only runs when one of its dependencies update. 
    The useCallback and useMemo Hooks are similar. The main difference is that useMemo returns
    a memoized value and useCallback returns a memorised function.
    
    What do you mean by useReducer ?
->  UseReducer is similar to useState Hook.
    if we have to keep track of multiple states in big Projects that rely on Complex Logic then we use 
    useReducer.
    UseReducer hook takes two arguments reducer function and intial state.
    UseReducer hook returns the state and a dispatch method.

    What do you mean by Redux in react?
->  Redux is a Pattern or libaray for managing and updating the application state using events
    called actions.It serves as a centeralized store for state that needs to be used across
    our entire application.

    What do you mean By Actions?
->  Actions are Plain JavaScript Objects that have a type field actions that only tell what to do
    ,but they don't tell how to do it. 

    What do you mean by Reducers?
->  Reducers are functions that take the current state and an action as arguments and return
    a new state result.

    What do you mean by Store?
->  A store is a state container which holds the application's state.
    Every Redux store has a single root reducer function.

Notes- The only way to change the state is to dispatch an action.
       The global state of our application is stored as an object inside a single store.

    What do you mean by Jest?
->  Jest is a free open source test framework created by facebook that has a great integration
    with React.js.
    It was primarily designed for React based apps but could be used to write automation
    scenarios for any Javascript Based Codebases.

    traverse your React Components' output    

    What do you mean by Redux Thunk ?
->  Redux Thunk middleware allows you to write action creators that return a function instead 
    of an action.    

    What do you mean by shouldComponentUpdate ?
->  It allows us to check and realize if the rendering of the component is needed or not. It always 
    return the boolean value and on the basis of the true and false value, we will render the 
    components.  

    What do you mean by Props Children ?
->  props.children is a special prop that is automatically passed to every component and it is used 
    to render the content included between the opening and closing tags when invoking a component.

    What do you mean Higher Order Component in React ?
->  A higher-order component is a function that takes another component as a argument and returns a new 
    component.      

    What do you mean by createRef, useRef and forwardRef ?
->  useRef can be used to access a HTML DOM elements directly.
    When we use ref as Attribute in any HTML element then specified value provided to ref will 
    access to all of the properties of that HTML element.  

    createRef is same like useRef which has access to HTML DOM elements directly but it is used in 
    case of class components.

    forwardRef allows us to forward a component's ref to another one. 
    forwardRef is a function used to pass the ref to a child component.
    forwardRef is a technique for automatically passing a ref through a component to one of its children.

    What do you mean by Redux toolkit in React ?
->  Redux Toolkit is a set of tools that helps simplify Redux development. It includes utilities for 
    creating and managing Redux stores, as well as for writing Redux actions and reducers.   

    What do you mean by extraReducers ?
->  The extraReducers allows you to respond to an action in our slice reducer but does 
    not create an action creator function.  

    What is the difference between reducers and extraReducers ?
->  The reducers property both creates an action creator function and responds to that action in the 
    slice reducer. The extraReducers allows you to respond to an action in your slice reducer but does 
    not create an action creator function.    
    
    What do you mean by createAsyncthunk ?
->  createAsyncThunk will generate three Redux action creators using createAction : pending , fulfilled ,
    and rejected . Each lifecycle action creator will be attached to the returned thunk action creator 
    so that your reducer logic can reference the action types and respond to the actions when dispatched.

    What do you mean by Async thunk in React.js ?
->  Async thunk means a piece of code that does some delayed work.       

    What do you mean by Virtual DOM ?
->  Virtual Dom is the copy of the entire DOM in the memory.
    React uses Virtual DOM exists which is like a lightweight copy of the actual DOM(a virtual 
    representation of the DOM). So for every object that exists in the original DOM, there is an object
    for that in React Virtual DOM. It is exactly the same, but it does not have the power to directly 
    change the layout of the document. Manipulating DOM is slow, but manipulating Virtual DOM is fast as 
    nothing gets drawn on the screen. So each time there is a change in the state of our application, 
    the virtual DOM gets updated first instead of the real DOM.
